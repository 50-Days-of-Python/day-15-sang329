# Day-15

Write a program takes a list of numbers as input and then convert the numbers to string.  
Then you have to add a thousand separator for readability.  
For example, `[1000000, 2356989]` should return `['1,000,000', '2,356,989']`, because it reads the same in reverse.

**Tests** | **1** | **2** | **3**
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**Input:** | `[1000000, 2356989]` | `[1286423, 87320765, 986468209]` | `[1000000, 2356989]` 
**Output:** | `['1,000,000', '2,356,989']` | `['1,286,423', '87,320,765', '986,468,209']` | `['10,00,000', '2,35,6989']`

## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.
